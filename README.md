# vector bluetooth

Some libs, etc (and a rudimentary CLI) for connecting to Vector over BLE

## Running on Linux

You'll have to do something like this on the built binary

```sh
# sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' /path/to/file
```

## Running on OS X

Completely untested, but let me know!

## Running on Windows

Doesn't work yet...
